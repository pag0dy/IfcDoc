      <p class="std">
        The <em>Industry Foundation Classes</em> IFC
        represent an open specification for <em>Building Information
        Modeling</em> BIM data that is exchanged and shared among the various
        participants in a building construction or facility management project.
        IFC's are the international openBIM standard.
      </p>
      <p class="std">
        This document contains the specification of the IFC standard. The
        specification consists of the data schema, represented as an EXPRESS
        schema specification and alternatively as an XML Schema specification, 
		and reference data, represented as XML definitions of property and quantity definitions.
      </p>
      <p class="std">
        An conforming software application is required to support a well
        defined subset of the data schema and referenced data. The subset it
        refered to as a Model View Definition MVD. A particular model view
        definition is defined to support one or many recognized work flows in
        the building construction and facility management industry sector. Each
        work flow identifies data exchange requirements that are to be
        supported by the conforming software applications.
      </p>
      <p class="std">
        buildingSMART International publishes official model view definitions
        and exchange requirements as related specifications. The official
        website for publication of this specification, related model view
        definitions and exchange requirements, and supporting materials such as
        implementer agreements, example data sets, references to development
        tools, discussion forum and issue database, and certification programs

        The IFC specification includes terms, concepts and data specification items that
        originate from use within disciplines, trades, and professions of the
        construction and facility management industry sector. Terms and
        concepts uses the plain English words, the data items within the data
        specification follow a naming convention.
      </p>
      <ul class="std">
        <li class="std">the data item names for types, entities, rules
        and functions start with the prefix "Ifc" and continue with the English
        words in CamelCase naming convention (no underscore, first letter in
        word in upper case);
        </li>
        <li class="std">the attribute names within an entity follow the
        CamelCase nameing convention with no prefix;
        </li>
        <li class="std">the property set definitions that are part of this
        standard start with the prefix "Pset_" and continue with the English
        words in CamelCase naming convention;
        </li>
        <li class="std">the quantity set definitions that are part of this
        standard start with the prefix "Qto_" and continue with the English
        words in CamelCase naming convention.

        The data schema architecture of IFC defines four conceptual
        layers, each individual schema is assigned to exactly one conceptual
        layer. Figure 1 shows the schema architecture

      <ol class="std">
        <li>
          <strong>Resource layer</strong> &mdash; the lowest layer includes all
          individual schemas containing resource definitions, those definitions
          do not include an globally unique identifier and shall not be used
          independently of a definition declared at a higher layer;
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Core layer</strong> &mdash; the next layer includes the
          kernel schema and the core extenstion schemas, containing the most
          general entity definitions, all entities defined at the core layer,
          or above carry a globally unique id and optionally owner and history
          information;
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Interoperability layer</strong> &mdash; the next layer
          includes schemas containing entity definitions that are specific to a
          general product, process or resource specialization used across
          several disciplines, those definitions are typicly utilized for
          inter-domain exchange and sharing of construction information;
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Domain layer</strong> &mdash; the highest layer includes
          schemas containing entity definitions that are specializations of
          products, processes or resources specific to a certain discipline,
          those definitions are typically utilized for intra-domain exchange
          and sharing of information.
